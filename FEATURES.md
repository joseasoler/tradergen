Ideology
---

Depending on the precepts and other details of the ideoligion of a trader, TraderGen will add extra stock to the trader, and restrict certain purchases. Each one of these two features can be enabled or disabled separately.

The Ideology support is fully compatible with editing ideoligions through dev mode. Existing traders will keep the stock they had, but what they are willing to sale or purchase may change. This may lead to some weird results but it should not cause any issues.

You can find a list of all changes below. Although the list mentions memes for easier understanding, changes are actually tied to individual precepts of each meme.
