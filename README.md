TraderGen is a mod for the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game. It modifies the random generation of traders, increasing stock variety and customization while improving mod compatibility.

Currently most of the features of the mod are only implemented for orbital traders, but expansions are planned for the future.

## Feature highlights

* Configurable amount of silver in stock. There are different settings for orbital, settlement, caravan and visitor traders. Compatible with all traders, both vanilla and modded.

* Customizable frequency of orbital traders. Compatible with any non-random storyteller, including modded ones.

* Orbital traders now have an specialization in addition to their type. An specialization adds a limited amount of stock but it may be particularly rare or useful. Each trader type has its own set of available specializations, with some of them being less common than the others.

* All vanilla traders (and several modded ones) have some minor changes to their stock aiming at increasing their variety and improving mod compatibility.

* Each orbital trader type has an expanded pool of random name rules which produces better fitting results.

## Give me the details!

### Specializations

**Bionics:** Adds prostheses between the industrial and ultratech technology levels. May rarely have a single archotech bionic in stock. Present in Combat, Exotic, Slaver and Imperial(requires Royalty) orbital traders.

**Cannibal:** Adds resources from morally questionable origins to the trader stock. Present in Combat and Slaver orbital traders.

### Trader changes

The following changes are applied to all vanilla orbital traders. Some modded traders receive the same support as well, as shown in the Mod Support section.

* Traders which could only have beer in stock now may have any alcohol type.

* Traders with textiles in stock now have increased variety but will not carry human leather in stock.

* Traders with recreation buildings in stock will now have increased stock variety.

* Bionics with an average price are more common. Really cheap and really expensive bionics are less common. Should have more impact when bionics mods are being used.

* Orbital traders usually only carry ranged weapons, armor or bionics which are industrial or better.

** Imperial orbital traders (with Royalty) have some recreation buildings and gluttonous food in stock.
