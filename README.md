TraderGen overhauls the random generation of stock in orbital traders to increase their stock variety while still generating combinations which make sense. Uncommon orbital traders are very specialized and carry rare stock.

Each orbital trader will have different specializations chosen randomly. Larger ships will have more specializations and as a result will have more stock quantity and variety, but smaller ships have higher chances of carrying infrequent wares.

Orbital traders coming from vanilla or mods with explicit support (see Mod support section below) will no longer appear, but their wares have been added to the orbital traders added by TraderGen.

## Features

* Random generation of orbital trader stock using ship specializations and ship size.
* Customizable amount of silver for orbital traders.
* Appropriate traders may have psylink neuroformers in stock (must be enabled using mod settings, requires Royalty).

## Mod support

TraderGen should support wares from most mods out of the box; please submit a [bug report](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you find any issues.

TraderGen also provides extra features when certain mods are enabled, including specific trader types, stock combinations and other tweaks to improve the experience. TraderGen includes extra content for the following mods:
