[TraderGen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804121197) adds new options for improving trader generation and trader stock in the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game.


* Orbital traders now have a specialization, which adds a limited amount of stock that could be particularly rare or useful. It is possible to modify the number of specializations or disable the feature entirely through the mod settings.


* Adjustable amount of silver in stock for orbital, settlement, caravan and visitor traders. Compatible with traders from mods.


* Mod setting for making traders such as the slaver orbital trader appear even when the population of the colony is large.


* Additional features when other mods are enabled.


* More diversity of names for vanilla orbital traders.


* Minor tweaks to vanilla trader stock, aiming at increasing their variety and improving mod compatibility.


You can find a detailed description of all specializations, trader tweaks and mod compatibility features in the [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) file.
