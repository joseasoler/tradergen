[TraderGen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804121197) is a [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) mod which improves trader stock variety and quantity, along with providing better mod support for traders.

The main feature added by the mod is specializations for orbital traders. Each specialization adds a limited amount of stock that could be particularly rare or useful. It is possible to modify the number of specializations or disable the feature entirely through the mod settings.

Orbital traders will now get more fitting names, with imperial orbital traders usually bearing the name of the noble that owns them, while combat orbital traders could have names based on animals or weapons.

TraderGen also provides extensive mod support. Orbital trader specializations are compatible with all mods, keeping their theme regardless of the contents of your modlist. There are also other tweaks and additions such as traders having other alcohol types in stock besides beer.

You can find a detailed description of all specializations, trader tweaks and mod compatibility features in the [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) file.
