TraderGen is a mod focused on improving trader stock variety and customization in the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game.

* Configurable amount of silver in stock for orbital, settlement, caravan and visitor traders. Compatible with traders from mods.

* Customizable frequency of orbital traders. Compatible with both vanilla and mod storytellers (you cannot tell Random storytellers what to do, though).

* Traders such as the slaver orbital trader become less frequent when the population of the colony increases until they cannot appear at all. With TraderGen, this can now be disabled through mod settings.

* Orbital traders now have an specialization in addition to their type. An specialization adds a limited amount of stock but it may be particularly rare or useful. It is possible to modify the number of specializations or disable the feature entirely through the mod settings.

* More diversity of names for orbital traders.

* Minor tweaks to vanilla trader stock, aiming at increasing their variety and improving mod compatibility.
