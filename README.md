TraderGen provides randomly generated orbital traders. Their stock variety is vastly increased, is more believable and supports most mods. Most aspects of this generation can be customized through the mod settings.

Fully compatible with the [Trader Ships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2046222331) mod. 

Keep in mind that since TraderGen overhauls orbital trade ship generation, orbital traders added by other mods will no longer appear. TraderGen should provide support for the wares of these mods; please submit a [bug report](CONTRIBUTING.md) if that is not the case.

## Features

* Orbital traders now have more variety in general, but each individual orbital trader may be specialized in certain types of wares.
* Orbital trader ships have different sizes. Larger ships have more stock quantity and variety, but smaller ships have higher chances of carrying infrequent wares.
* Uncommon orbital traders are very specialized and carry rare wares.
* Customizable amount of silver for orbital traders.
