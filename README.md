TraderGen is a mod for the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game. It overhauls the random generation of stock for traders, increasing stock variety and customization while improving mod compatibility.

Currently most of the features of the mod are only implemented for orbital traders, but expansions are planned for the future.

## Features

* Vanilla orbital traders have increased stock variety by default and include some mod compatibility improvements.

## Orbital trader changes

### Bulk goods

* May have any alcohol type in stock, instead of only beer. Cheaper varieties are more common.
* Increased variety and quantity of textiles in stock. Never has human leather in stock by default.

### Combat

* Guaranteed to have a few pieces of power armor in stock.
* May rarely have a shield belt or smokepop belt in stock.
