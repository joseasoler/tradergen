TraderGen is a mod for the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game. It overhauls the random generation of stock in orbital traders to increase their stock variety while generating logical combinations.

Orbital traders from mods not supported by TraderGen will appear normally. Orbital traders coming from vanilla or mods with explicit support (see Mod support section below) will no longer appear. Their wares have been added to the orbital traders created by TraderGen.

## Features

* Random generation of orbital trader stock using ship specializations and ship size.
* Customizable amount of silver for orbital traders.
* Appropriate traders may have psylink neuroformers in stock (must be enabled using mod settings, requires Royalty).

## How it works

Stock is grouped in loosely defined categories. For example, an orbital trader with the Medicine category will always have different types of medicine, neutroamine and related goods in stock.  Each category may in turn have different specializations.

An orbital trader can have one or more categories, depending on their size. Small orbital traders have just one, medium traders have two, and large traders have three. Uncommon orbital traders do not follow category rules and have their stock specifically defined instead.

Certain categories become less common as ship size increases, as larger ships tend to be less specialized.

## Mod support

TraderGen should support wares from most mods out of the box; please submit a [bug report](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you find any issues.

TraderGen also provides extra features when certain mods are enabled, including specific trader types, stock combinations and other tweaks to improve the experience. TraderGen includes extra content for the following mods:
